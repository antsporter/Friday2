What Was The Challenge?

Create a program that takes any number between 1 - 999 and converts it into the corresponding number in plain english. 

As a stretch convert 1000 - 9999 and converts it into the corresponding number in plain english.

How I Expected The Challenge To Go...

I was happy that the challenge seemed to use existing logic learnt and build on the knowledge base.

What Went Well...

I was able to think logically through the process and finally click how i need to write into the files to tell the computer what i want it to do.

What Didn't Go As Planned...

To begin with I tried to use switch statements and various other ways that made less sense to me. I started scribbling on post it notes how my brain would use an if statement and it finally made snese.

Improvements For Future Challenges

Start with writing it down or thinking deeply first before trying to go straight to code.
